##PokedexApp

is an App where you can look for any pokemon of any generation, also if you want you can go for the detail view pokemon, and why not? add that pokemon to your team.

I developed this app to improve my skills and I really hope it can help you to understand some topics about Android Programming with Kotlin.

##Topics

some topics and frameworks that I implemented in this app were

- Architecture: MVVM
- Repository pattern
- Clean Architecture
- LiveData
- ROOM for local storage
- Retrofit and GSON for consuming API
- MOCKK for unit test
- Coroutines for thread management
- Hilt Dagger for dependencies injection
- Glide for load images
- Pallete for get of image colors
